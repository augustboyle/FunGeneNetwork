Visualize 1,528,726 co-essential genetic interactions among 17,634 genes (0.98% of all possible pairs)

See how to make figures similar to panels 4B-C, 5F, 6C-D, EV2, EV5C from my paper: https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20188594

This work informed future development of the Broad Cancer DepMap gene dependency resource.
